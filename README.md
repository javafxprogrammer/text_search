# text_search
Searches for text in files in a given director and a substring
Recursively traverses the directory and its sub-directories to find the file.
Prints the file name, file contents & number on which the text is found.
Will need to optimize the code to run on a large directory.
Works with .txt & .sql files but can be modified to work with any file.
