# text_search
Searches for text in files in a given directory and a substring
<br>Recursively traverses the directory and its sub-directories to find the file.
<br>Prints the file name, file contents & number on which the text is found.
<br>Will need to optimize the code to run on a large directory & only print line on which text is found & not entire file contents.
<br>Works with .txt & .sql files but can be modified to work with any file.
